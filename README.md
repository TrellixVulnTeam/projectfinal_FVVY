# RESISTOR ONLINE CALCULATOR
   
My project is about an online web application which allows users to perform basics operations on resistors. Initially, the application was meant to be entirely designed in python but as a student in electronic filed; it turns out that a web application was a better idea in order to give remote access to myself and everybody in the same field. 
       
## Presentation of the web application
The Domain name of the web application is  **resistor-onlinecalculator.herokuapp.com** and is hosted on HEOKU freedev plan.
The online calculator is a Flask web-application which doesn't use ad database but is implemented using the following resources:

1. Python(Programming language):
    * Python3 used with Flask framework to provide the app routes and jinja2 for dynamic templating.
2. HTML(Markup language):
    * Used to build the user interface.
3. CSS3(Styling language):
    * Used to style the HTML with the purpose of making a nicer user interface. 
4. JavaScript(Programming language):
    * Used as the programming language containing the logic for calculation for calculations which reduces the user interaction time(user side calculation).
    * Also used for templating and refreshing asynchronously input fields when some specifics events occur.
 
## Online Calculator operations 
In electronic field, some basic operations are usually performed such as computing the total resistance or the total conductance in a resistor circuit, computing the resistor's value using its color code ...

The following operations can be performed using the online resistor calculator:
1. Computing the value of a 4,5 or 6 bands resistor using its color code.
2. Knowing the value of each resistor in a resistor circuit you can also compute :
    * The total resistance value in parallel circuit resistors,
    * The total resistance value in series circuit resistors,
    * The total conductance value in parallel circuit resistors,
    * The total conductance value in series circuit resistors.

## How to use the web-application 

very easy and clear to use, you don't need a particular guideline.
